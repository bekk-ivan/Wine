# Wine
Wine quality model

### Goal
- To analyse the impact of certain features on the quality of wine and create a model to predict the quality of wine 

### Dataset:<br >
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):<br >
1 - fixed acidity<br >
2 - volatile acidity<br >
3 - citric acid<br >
4 - residual sugar<br >
5 - chlorides<br >
6 - free sulfur dioxide<br >
7 - total sulfur dioxide<br >
8 - density<br >
9 - pH<br >
10 - sulphates<br >
11 â€“ alcohol<br >

Output variable (based on sensory data):<br >
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
